    "    - `joblib` is used for saving and loading Python objects, such as machine learning models, to and from disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **For suppressing warnings - [warnings](https://docs.python.org/3/library/warnings.html)**\n",
    "    - `warnings`: Controls warning messages\n",
    "    - `warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')`: Suppresses warning messages for cleaner output\n",

    "- This step splits the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data. The `train_test_split()` function is used to randomly split the data, ensuring that the target variable's distribution is preserved in both sets.\n",
    "- `stratify=y` in train_test_split ensures that the train and test sets have the same proportion of each class label as the original dataset. This is important for classification tasks, especially when classes are imbalanced, as it preserves the class distribution in both splits.\n",
    "- `test_size=0.3` indicates that 30% of the data will be used for testing, while 70% will be used for training.\n",
    "- `random_state=53` ensures reproducibility of the split, meaning that every time you run the code, you will get the same split of data.\n",
    "- `StandardScaler()` is used to standardize the features by setting mean = 0 and variance = 1. This is important for kNN, as it is sensitive to the scale of the features. Standardization ensures that all features contribute equally to the distance calculations.\n",
    "- `fit_transform()` is applied to the training data to compute the mean and standard deviation, and then transform the data accordingly.\n",

    "*Analogy:* This is similar to how a student learning a subject is not exposed to only one past paper that they can memorize.
